Pain Catastrophizing Scale- Child Version (PCS-C)
When I am in pain, I worry all the time about whether the pain will end
When I am in pain, I feel I can’t go on like this much longer
When I am in pain, it’s terrible and I think it’s never going to get better
When I am in pain, it’s awful and I feel that it takes over me
When I am in pain, I can’t stand it anymore
When I am in pain, I become afraid that the pain will get worse
When I am in pain, I keep thinking of other painful events
When I am in pain, I want the pain to go away
When I am in pain, I can’t keep it out of my mind
When I am in pain, I keep thinking about how much it hurts
When I am in pain, I keep thinking about how much I want the pain to stop
When I am in pain, there is nothing I can do to stop the pain
When I am in pain, I wonder whether something serious may happen
Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)
1. I'm afraid that I might injure myself if I exercise
2. If I were to try to overcome it, my pain would increase
3. My body is telling me I have something dangerously wrong
4. My pain would probably be relieved if I were to exercise
5. People aren’t taking my medical condition seriously enough
6. My accident has put my body at risk for the rest of my life
7. Pain always means I have injured my body
8. Just because something aggravates my pain does not mean it is dangerous
Limited in:
9. I am afraid that I might injure myself accidentally
10. Simply being careful that I do not make any unnecessary movements is the safest thing I can do to prevent my pain from worsening
11. I wouldn’t have this much pain if there weren’t something potentially dangerous going on in my body
12. Although my condition is painful, I would be better off if I were physically active
13. Pain lets me know when to stop exercising so that I don’t injure myself
14. It’s really not safe for a person with a condition like mine to be physically active
15. I can’t do all the things normal people do because it’s too easy for me to get injured
16. Even though something is causing me a lot of pain, I don’t think it’s actually dangerous
17. No one should have to exercise when he/she is in pain

PAPC Barriers to Care
Do you sometimes forget to take your medicine?
People sometimes miss taking their meds for reasons other than forgetting. Over the past 2 weeks were there any days when you did not take your medicine?
Have you ever cut back or stopped taking your medicine without telling your doctor because you felt worse when you took it?
When you travel or leave home, do you sometimes forget to bring along your medicine?
Did you take all your medicines yesterday?
When you feel like your symptoms are under control, do you sometimes stop taking your medicine?
Taking medicine everyday is a real inconvenience for some people. Do you ever feel hassled about sticking to your treatment plan?
How often do you have difficulty remembering to take all your medicine?
